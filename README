Pointfree refactoring tool
==========================

Stand-alone command-line version of the point-less plugin for lambdabot. 
Detailed information about the use of this tool is available at 
http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pointfree.

Integration with GHCi: Make sure that the directory containing the pointfree 
executable is in your PATH environment variable and add the following line to 
your GHCi configuration file:

:def pf \str -> return $ ":! pointfree \"" ++ str ++ "\""

Or modify the line to point directly to the executable. Invoke pointfree with 
commands like

:pf \x y -> x + y

Future directions
=================

It would be nice to make pointfree a library that operated on ASTs.

Installation
============

This tool can be installed with Stack:
`stack install`: create a binary and copy it to ~/.local/bin
